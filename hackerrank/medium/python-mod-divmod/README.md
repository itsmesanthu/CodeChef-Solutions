# Mod Divmod

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Medium-yellow)

## Problem

One of the built-in functions of Python is _divmod_, which takes two arguments $a$ and $b$ and returns a tuple containing the quotient of $a/b$ first and then the remainder $a%b$.  

For example:  

	>>> print divmod(177,10)
    (17, 7)
    
Here, the integer division is `177/10 => 17` and the modulo operator is `177%10 => 7`.
    
**Task**  
Read in two integers, $a$ and $b$, and print three lines.  
The first line is the integer division $a//b$ (While using Python2 remember to import `division` from `__future__`).  
The second line is the result of the modulo operator: $a\%b$.  
The third line prints the *divmod* of $a$ and $b$.  

**Input Format**  
The first line contains the first integer, $a$, and the second line contains the second integer, $b$.   

**Output Format**  
Print the result as described above.  

**Sample Input**  

    177
    10

**Sample Output**  

    17
    7
    (17, 7)

print(a % b)
print(divmod(a, b))

```
